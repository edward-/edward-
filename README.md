 # Hello! 👋

My name is Edward and I am a Golang developer.

I am familiar with a wide range of technologies, such as Docker, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, Golang, Node.js, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Kafka, and AWS. I am well-versed in SOLID principles, design patterns, clean architecture, RESTful APIs, microservices, and testing, among other key concepts.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Terraform, and Python.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Soccer Enthusiast | Coffeeholic | Dog father 🐾
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on AI projects.
